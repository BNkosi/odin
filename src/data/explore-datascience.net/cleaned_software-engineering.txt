Overview
Join the sexiest career of the 21st Century
Software Engineering is one of the fastest growing careers with some of the highest salaries paid.
Work with Some of the Best
Our support team have been there and done that - they have a solid academic background and are experienced practitioners of data science and software development in various fields such as Utilities, Financial Services and EDSA's own platforms.
Learn How to Solve Problems
The course is built actual problems that South Africans face, and teaches how to build useful software as potential solutions.
Apply the skills
EXPLORE prides itself on the practicality of the course. Participants must be able to apply the skills/knowledge that they acquired to do amazing things.
Extended Access To Material
Participants will have extended access to the material that are covered in the course, allowing them to revisit the techniques to keep it fresh in their mind. 
Curriculum
Start thinking like a programmer
This course will provide students with the knowledge, skills and experience to start their Python Programmer and Java associate certification journeys. Certification is a vital step in starting or changing to a career in software development as a junior software developer, software tester, or Systems designer. The course will teach you to think algorithmically, manipulate data, instruct computers to perform complex tasks, and build some basic human-computer interaction applications in the form of games.
Over the first three months, the course will take you from being computer literate to being able to design, write, debug and use Python to solve a variety of computational problems. This section will also cultivate the basic concepts underlying software development technologies, and prepare you for the Object Oriented Programming concepts crucial to Java Development
Understand the core concepts of computing: instructions, commands, and programming
Learn the fundamental components of a Python program
Learn the fundamental instructions that define a program's logic, execution, and flow
Utilize functions and data structures to generalize program functions
Write reusable code with Modules and packages
Learn to handle exceptions in order to safely work with files
Understand the basics of Object Oriented Programming with Python
Ready to take the PCEP
The second half of the course builds off the solid conceptual understanding of programming concept gained by writing Python in order to teach the Java programming language. It covers the same concepts, but in an Object Oriented Programming paradigm.. 
Understand the Java Environment: Java SE, the JDK and the JRE/li>
Learn the fundamental components, structure, and execution of a Java program
Learn to handle files and exceptions

Able to build a linear regression model in python and test the results of predictions
Able to build a logistic regression model in python and test the results of predictions
Able to optimize models to enhance performance
Learn to apply advanced models, such as random forests and support vector machines, to real world problems
Learn to apply unsupervised techniques, such as k-means clustering and dimensionality reduction, to your data
Able to gather insight and derive patterns from unstructured data

Learn one of the most in demand skills out there
Software development is a vast field and one that is creative, demanding and extremely rewarding. A career as a software developer gives you the opportunity to learn about the business as well as technology. Here are just a few reasons from some of our FDM software development consultants on why this is such a great career choice.
Software development is all about problem solving. Few things are more rewarding accomplishing something someone else thought impossible
Software development is creative. The processing speed of our machines is increasing exponentially. Yesterday's solutions are obsolete tomorrow. 
Software development requires continuous growth. New technologies, new ways to solve problems faster and better
Software development is project based. You'll rarely be on a solo mission
Software development is for everyone! Powerful open source algorithms that can read, write, translate and see are now available for everyone to use.
Everything is a computer. Even your fridge. Learn to command computers
