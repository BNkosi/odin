Our support team have been there and done that - they are experienced practitioners of data science in various fields such as Utilities, Retail and Financial Services; with a solid academic background.
Learn How to Solve Problems
The course is built around solving actual problems whilst learning about the latest data analytics techniques. 
Apply the skills
EXPLORE prides itself on the practicality of the course. Participants must be able to apply the skills/knowledge that they acquired to do amazing things. 
Extended Access To Material
Participants will have extended access to the material that are covered in the course, allowing them to revisit the techniques to keep it fresh in their mind.
Curriculum
Start thinking like a data analyst
This course will provide students with the knowledge, skills and experience to get a job as a data analyst - which requires a mix of programming, statistical understanding and the ability to apply both skills in new and challenging domains. The course will teach students to gather data, apply statistical analysis to answer questions with that data and make their insights and information as actionable as possible.
Students will gain an overview of the fundamental skills required to be a data analyst. They will learn how to clean, analyse and visualise data as well as how to effectively communicate the findings to drive actionable interventions. The tools to be used will be Excel, Power BI, Microsoft SQL and GSuite.
Able to analyse datasets in Excel by using complex formulas and pivot tables.
Able to create and query from a SQL database to extract valuable information.
Able to build dynamic and interactive dashboards using Power BI.
Able to effectively communicate the findings after an analysis.
Students will learn programming in Python. From writing basic syntax to using complex functions to automate analysis.
Able to write and understand basic syntax in Python as well as to debug errors.
Able to write complex functions to automate analysis.
Able to use the Numpy and Pandas libraries in Python for data analysis.
Students will solve real-world problems by building regression and classification prediction models in python. It will involve building, improving and communicating models from a raw and unclean dataset.
Able to prepare data appropriately for model building purposes.
Able to build a linear regression model in python and test the results of predictions.
Able to build a logistic regression model in python and test the results of predictions.
Able to optimize models to enhance performance.

Learn one of the most in demand skills out there
Four megatrends are fundamentally changing the shape of our world:
Vast amounts of data are being generated every minute.
The processing speed of our machines is increasing exponentially.
We now have cloud providers who can store insane amounts of data for a few dollars.
Powerful open source algorithms that can read, write, translate and see are now available to everyone.
Data Analytics is the skillset used to harness the power of these tectonic shifts in our world. Over the last 4 years, the rise of job opportunities for data analysts has become almost level to those traditionally seen for software engineering positions.

A data analyst focus is on statistically analysing, visualising and communicating data, and only using basic programming for data analysis. A data scientist uses more machine learning algorithms to solve problems and uses complex programming for more than just data analyses (e.g. data engineering).
You will solve fun problems like picking the best football team based on player stats as well as more practical problems like predicting which policyholder will make a medical insurance claim in the next year.
No. Even though there is complex maths behind some of the models, we won�t explicitly cover it. However, the material will be available for those who are interested in the details.
No. If you apply for a sponsorship however, there will be some documentation needed.
At EXPLORE we have what is called the Belt system. You will receive points for completing tutorials, test results, project results and peer assessment. These points will build up and can be mapped to a certain belt level which ranger from white to black.
