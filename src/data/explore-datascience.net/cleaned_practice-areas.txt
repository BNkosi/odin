Fibre Roll Out
Rolling out a Fibre network is a complicated process. It is a function of a number of things. EXPLORE helped a large Telecommunications company optimise its roll out plan by building a model that prioritized the roll-out plan with a projected RoI set per area.
Reducing the Fault Rate
A large network built over many decades spanning 1,000�s of miles is prone to break. When customers experience a fault it is an expensive exercise for the operator as it needs to send Technicians across the country to fix the issue. The customer may also churn due to the poor service which results in lower Revenues.
Supply and Demand Modelling
Supply and Demand are two major components that comprise a utility network. The efficient management of these two components is vital to both cost efficient operation of the network and maintaining customer satisfaction.
System Risk Modelling
Utility networks are comprised of components that vary in a multitude of properties, for example age, material and size. They�re prone to faults which could lead to supply interruption, property damage and most importantly threat to life.
