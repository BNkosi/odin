Companies That Have Hired from Us
In Jan and Feb 2019 we brought 3 people from the EXPLORE 2018 class into Digital & Data.
They are some of the most amazing people I have ever had the pleasure of recruiting in
my 10 years of people management experience. Their positive and infectious attitude,
ambition, curiosity, passion for data science and just generally being wonderful human
beings means that EXPLORE presents us with a unique opportunity to act as a pipeline for
talent into our organisation. These individuals also graduate from Explore with a rare
skill set that is immediately implementable in our business context.

Student Testimonials
Murendeni
The course taught me things I never thought I could apprehend, at the beginning of
each sprint the problem seems like mammoth of a task much like climbing Mount
Kilimanjaro but at the end the mountain top is within reach with the skills and
strategic thinking that I�ve adopted in programme. The course is all about the
passion of solving real- life problems which is why it will make me a rare
knowledge and data skill.
Joanne
I have been challenged here more than ever before, but I�ve also had the greatest support
system in the staff and students at EDSA. It�s been an incredibly rewarding experience to
be allowed to grow and thrive, and to be a valued piece of the magnificent structure that
is the academy. EDSA will push you to your limits. It will challenge, and frustrate you,
and at times make you want to pull your hair out, but it will also mould you into a better
version of yourself, and be one of the most rewarding experiences you will ever have.
Ebrahim
EDSA is a fantastic academy and has an exceptional Data Science program. The content outlined
in the course is well structured and very relevant to the world of Data Science. The supervisors
are very friendly and assisting and are always there for guidance and assistance. Being in the
academy also awards you the opportunity to grow as a person and learn from fellow students
from different backgrounds with different experiences. It�s a place of hard work and dedication
and I am really glad to have got into the academy and enjoy this amazing experience.
