Curriculum
Start thinking like a data scientist
This course will provide students with the overview of knowledge and skills required to kick-start their data science learning. It will teach students to apply statistical analysis to answer questions with that data and present their insights and information as actionable as possible.
Students will learn about the basics of programming using python as well as the environment that they will be writing the code in.
Able to write python code in google colab
Able to work with various data types in python
Able to write logical code that includes for loops and functions
Students will learn about how to present valuable insights after performing analysis, which will all be done using python.
Understand the basics of data visualisation
Able to create graphs using matplotlib library
Able to build interactive dashboards using Bokeh library
Students will learn about statistics and the world of prediction, which will include building and testing their own models in python.
Understand the basic of statistics
Able to pre-process data to be ready for modelling
Able to build models in python using Scikit Learn library
Instructors
Meet your teachers
We take teaching seriously. Great teachers inspire us to connect with topics on a profound level. With experience in the field and the classroom, our data science instructors are unmatched. Simply put: students learn from the best.
Jaco Jansen van Rensburg
Jaco is a Lead Data Scientist in the EXPLORE Data Science Academy. He has spent the bulk of his career on scientific and industrial research and holds a PhD in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on mathematical modelling and optimisation.
Dewald Botha
Dewald is an actuary and senior data scientist. He was one of the first brave souls to join the EXPLORE ship in 2016. He is managing EXPLORE's learning platform, Athena, and leading the corporate training - 2/3 day bootcamps to upskill employees.
Join the fastest-growing corner of the tech industry
More than ever before, industries are capturing data on a variety of topics, behaviours and trends. Without data science, this information stays stuck - no story to tell and no insights to share. In order to determine business goals, more and more companies are looking to data scientists to fill in the gaps and find opportunities never before considered or understood.
Over the last 4 years, the rise of job opportunities for data scientists has become almost level to those traditionally seen for software engineering positions.
As this area expertise has grown, the positions within the field become more nuanced. After completing our NYC Data Science Bootcamp, students will not only be able to secure a job as a data scientist, but can also consider pursuing any of the following related positions.
Data Engineer
Machine Learning Engineer
Big data Engineer
Back-End Engineer
Natural Language Processing
