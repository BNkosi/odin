EXPLORE prides itself on the practicality of the course. Participants must be able to apply the skills/knowledge that they acquired to do amazing things.
Extended Access To Material
Participants will have extended access to the material that are covered in the course, allowing them to revisit the techniques to keep it fresh in their mind. 
Curriculum
Start thinking like a data scientist
This course will provide students with the knowledge, skills and experience to get a job as a data scientist - which requires a mix of programming, statistical understanding and the ability to apply both skills in new and challenging domains. The course will teach students to gather data, visualise data, apply statistical analysis to answer questions with that data and make their insights and information as actionable as possible.
Students will gain an overview of Data Science and the fundamental skills required to be a data scientist. They will learn how to clean, analyse and visualise data as well as how to effectively communicate the findings to drive actionable interventions. The tools to be used will be Python, Power BI, Microsoft SQL and GSuite.
Able to create and query a SQL database to extract valuable information
Able to query analyse datasets in Python by using Numpy, Pandas and Pyodbc
Able to write and understand basic syntax in Python as well as to debug errors
Able to write complex functions to automate analysis
Able to build dynamic and interactive dashboards using Power BI
Able to effectively communicate the findings after an analysis
Students will solve real-world problems by building regression, classification and unsupervised learning algorithms in python. It will involve data exploration insight, building, improving and communicating models from a raw and unstructured dataset.
Able to prepare data appropriately for model building purposes.
Able to build a linear regression model in python and test the results of predictions.
Able to build a logistic regression model in python and test the results of predictions.
Able to optimize models to enhance performance.
Learn to apply advanced models, such as random forests and support vector machines, to real world problems.
Learn to apply unsupervised techniques, such as k-means clustering and dimensionality reduction, to your data.
Able to gather insight and derive patterns from unstructured data.

Learn one of the most in demand skills out there
Four megatrends are fundamentally changing the shape of our world:
Vast amounts of data are being generated every minute.
The processing speed of our machines is increasing exponentially.
We now have cloud providers who can store insane amounts of data for a few dollars.
Powerful open source algorithms that can read, write, translate and see are now available to everyone.
Data Science is the skillset used to harness the power of these tectonic shifts in our world. With the Data Scientist�s tool-kit almost any problem can now be solved using cloud-based technology and the set of algorithms that are the Data Scientists domain. 
It is no surprise that Data Scientists are one of the most highly paid and in demand skills of the 21st Century. In fact, the job �Data Scientist� was rated the �sexiest profession of the 21st Century� by the Harvard Business Review.

Curriculum
Start thinking like a data scientist
This course will provide students with the knowledge, skills and experience to get a job as a data scientist - which requires a mix of programming, statistical understanding and the ability to apply both skills in new and challenging domains. The course will teach students to gather data, visualise data, apply statistical analysis to answer questions with that data and make their insights and information as actionable as possible.
Students will gain an overview of Data Science and the fundamental skills required to be a data scientist. They will learn how to clean, analyse and visualise data as well as how to effectively communicate the findings to drive actionable interventions. The tools to be used will be Python, Power BI, Microsoft SQL and GSuite.
Able to create and query a SQL database to extract valuable information
Able to query analyse datasets in Python by using Numpy, Pandas and Pyodbc
Able to write and understand basic syntax in Python as well as to debug errors
Able to write complex functions to automate analysis
Able to build dynamic and interactive dashboards using Power BI
Able to effectively communicate the findings after an analysis
Students will solve real-world problems by building regression, classification and unsupervised learning algorithms in python. It will involve data exploration insight, building, improving and communicating models from a raw and unstructured dataset.
Able to prepare data appropriately for model building purposes.
Able to build a linear regression model in python and test the results of predictions.
Able to build a logistic regression model in python and test the results of predictions.
Able to optimize models to enhance performance.
Learn to apply advanced models, such as random forests and support vector machines, to real world problems.
Learn to apply unsupervised techniques, such as k-means clustering and dimensionality reduction, to your data.
Able to gather insight and derive patterns from unstructured data.

Learn one of the most in demand skills out there
Four megatrends are fundamentally changing the shape of our world:
Vast amounts of data are being generated every minute.
The processing speed of our machines is increasing exponentially.
We now have cloud providers who can store insane amounts of data for a few dollars.
Powerful open source algorithms that can read, write, translate and see are now available to everyone.
Data Science is the skillset used to harness the power of these tectonic shifts in our world. With the Data Scientist�s tool-kit almost any problem can now be solved using cloud-based technology and the set of algorithms that are the Data Scientists domain. 
It is no surprise that Data Scientists are one of the most highly paid and in demand skills of the 21st Century. In fact, the job �Data Scientist� was rated the �sexiest profession of the 21st Century� by the Harvard Business Review.
