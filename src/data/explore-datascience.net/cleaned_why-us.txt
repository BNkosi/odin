Do Amazing Things
We're reinventing education by teaching skills that are relevant, practical and highly employable. We teach our students how to work in teams to solve problems using the latest technologies preparing them for the world of work.
What We Believe In
Talent is Everywhere
Our country has crazy talent. We have some of the best skills on the planet. And it's often in the places you least expect. We find that talent and we accelerate it.
Teams Eat Individuals for Breakfast
A small group of committed individuals can change the world. Indeed that is the only thing that ever has.
No Degree Required
We don't care about your degree. We care that you have passion, purpose and aptitude. That you have fire in your heart. That you're on a mission to make the world better.
Walk Barefoot
We only hire and recruit individuals who we want to spend time with. Life is short. There's not enough time to waste it on people who lack humility.
It's NOT About the Code
Coding is easy. Algorithms are a piece of cake. The real stuff you'll learn are how to be a better, stronger and more humble human being.
