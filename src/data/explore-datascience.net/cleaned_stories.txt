Alumni Story
6 Years later, here I am - a widowed woman with a 3-year-old son. With his adorable chubby cheeks
and innocent large eyes glaring at me I thought to myself, �now is the time, I need professional
skills. Out of everything this past year, I�ve learned never to underestimate the power and
ability I have within myself, the importance of resilience and pushing through no matter how
daunting things may seem, I learned that I, Zaheeda, mother of Hamza, can be a force to be
reckoned with. I can be an asset to the corporate/start-up world while given the opportunity
to home and master my skills.
Attending EDSA was one of the best things I have done for my life. The experience and knowledge
I have gained is far more valuable than anything I have done in my life. The environment is
ideal for the type of work associated with it. It�s very interactive and intuitive. I enjoyed
the subtle competitive space we work at, and it brought out the best in me. I am glad and
grateful for the opportunity to have Explored my untapped abilities.
Approaching problems with the end in mind � that is, how I�m going to solve
them has been a key aspect at the Academy. It has provided variety of avenues
and allowing me to venture into untapped areas with the skills I�ve obtained at
the Academy. I now understand the modern world in a more exciting new way.
Have you wondered what it takes to be employable in South Africa and become
of Explore Data Science Academy. It takes only a simple application to be one of
the luckiest South Africans to learn the Data Science skills from Python,
Databases, Data analytics, Cloud Computing, to Machine learning. I got
employed by Sanlam immediately after my training, and it is because of EDSA
that I enjoy my job and contribute effectively to the country�s GDP.
