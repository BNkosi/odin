EXPLORE with gumption!\n\n\nStudying part time and doing the course at the same time\nYou are required to be on campus every day and the course demands 40 hours per week of study. We generally discourage people from working / studying elsewhere at the same time while doing the course.\nStruggling to scroll, register and log in\nWe have noticed that some login/register modals don't scroll for certain pages, on certain browsers, on certain operating systems. We are looking to fix the issue. For now, I’d suggest you try using a PC if possible. Failing that, login/register from the homepage only. Failing that, try to force load the desktop site (Common on phone browser menus. the item above the arrow says \"Desktop Site\") Failing that, try use a different browser, starting with Firefox.\n\nDo you offer classrooms and lectures?\nOur on-campus learning is technology based and the majority of it is conducted through our state-of-the-art learning platform. Pop-up classes, webinars, lectures, meetings and project work make up the rest of the learning experience.

The online courses are fully online, and all components are online based.\n\nIs the online (part time) course designed to enable students to be industry ready at completion? Or is this more an introduction to data science? (i.e. would I be able to work in the data science filed after completion)\nThis is difficult for us to ascertain beforehand, as we have no way of knowing what your skill levels are or what your abilities will be after completing the course. I can however let you know that the content is the same for both on campus and online students. And both will receive the workplace support. The difference in the money back guarantee is the cost of the on-campus course which allows access to the career services package.\n\nHow does the time commitment look like? For full time students. I have a “full time” job, but the hours are flexible\nThis is a tough course and to thrive you need to put in focused effort from 8 am to 5 pm, Monday to Friday every week and you might need to put in more little time to complete your work.\n\nHow do you guys guarantee job placement, and is this based on any pre-requisites?\nNo, it’s not. Job placement is not 100% guaranteed, however, we do really aim/tend to place you guys and we also doing our best to assist with placements upon complexion of the course. \n\nDoes the course include the development of a portfolio?\nThe course is a work-based skills program so everything they learn is based on practical projects. So, the entire thing can be used as a portfolio.\n\nOnline course, Will I get to meet someone to assist me if I struggle? \nNo, however you will have scheduled webinars and an online chat platform that give you access to the student community and facilitators if you need support.
