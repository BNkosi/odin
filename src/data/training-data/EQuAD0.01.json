Next Course January 13, 2021 - April 14, 2021 Applications will open again in the future Overview Learn to automate processes and analysis. Programming is one of the most important job skills for the future. Guided by some of the Best Our support team have been there and done that - they are experienced practitioners of data science in various fields such as Utilities, Retail and Financial ; with a solid academic background. Learn How to Solve Problems The course is built around solving actual problems whilst learning about the latest programming basics and techniques. Apply the skills EXPLORE prides itself on the practicality of the course. Participants must be able to apply the skills or knowledge that they acquired in your everyday job to impact their business. Extended access to Material Participants will have extended access to the material that are covered in the course, allowing them to revisit the techniques to keep it fresh in their mind. Curriculum Start thinking like a programmer Participants will learn how to utilise the power of Python. They will start by covering the basics such as working with data types and variables to more complex topics such as writing functions, using loops and conditional statements. They will also learn to import and use libraries. Students will cover the basics of programming in python - basic syntax, data types, debugging errors, using variables and logic statements, coding for-loops and writing functions. Able to work with various data types in Python - numbers, lists, strings, booleans, dictionaries, tuples, sets Able to use logic statements  Able to write for-loops and while-loops Able to debug errors Able to write functions to perform tasks more efficiently Students will utilise external libraries in python for data analysis - Numpy and Pandas. They will also write functions to select the most optimal football teams based on player attributes and positions. Able to work with numpy arrays  Able to work with pandas dataframes Able to manipulate pandas dataframes Instructors Meet your teachers We take teaching seriously.
